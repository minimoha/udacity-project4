## Project Overview

This project operationalizes a Machine Learning Microservice API. 

Given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project operationalizes a Python flask app that serves out predictions about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.


### Project Tasks

The project goal is to operationalize machine learning microservice using kubernetes, the following tasks were performed:

* Test project code using linting
* Complete Dockerfile to containerize the application
* Deploy the containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested
